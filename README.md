# stimsrv-client-servercanvas

A client for [stimsrv](https://github.com/floledermann/stimsrv) to use with old & simple browsers. Thi client renders stimuli on the server using [node-canvas](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas).

**Consider using [stimsrv-client-simpebrowser](https://github.com/floledermann/stimsrv-client-simpebrowser) instead, which uses puppeteer for server-side rendering and delivers more accurate results. This client is provided as an example and for historic reference, and will not be developed further.**
